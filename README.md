# ITT300 Packet Tracer Project

This repository contains our **ITT300 (Introduction to Data Communication and Networking)** group project, where we designed and implemented a two-subnet LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer.  

## 📌 Project Overview
- Designed and configured a **STAR topology network** with two subnets (Subnet A & Subnet B).  
- Configured essential services:
  - **DHCP** – automatic IP assignment
  - **DNS** – domain name resolution
  - **HTTP Server** – hosted a simple UiTM welcome page
- Ensured inter-subnet communication via **router configuration** with `ip helper-address`.  
- Tested connectivity using **ping**, **envelope test**, and **web access test**.  

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `GP_itt300_THE_REAL_FINAL.pkt` – The Packet Tracer simulation file.  
- `ITT300-report(1).pdf` – Detailed documentation of the project (design, configuration, testing, challenges & solutions).  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.2 or newer recommended).  
2. Explore the network topology and device configurations.  
3. Test connectivity using the provided simulation.
